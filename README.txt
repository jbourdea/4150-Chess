Running our test suite made in our test framework
In order to run our test suite, run the program in Eclipse the default way (the main is in Game.java). From the main menu, select option 4, and then you will be brought to our testing menu for our testing suite. In order to run all the tests, please enter “1”. To return to the main menu, enter “0”. To exit, you may type “exit”. The testing suites all go through an artificial simulation of events in a game, to show you step by step that our program runs bug free.

Running JUnit Tests
JUnit comes with Eclipse so no additional tools are required to run the JUnit tests. To run the JUnit Tests, inside Eclipse right click the “test” folder, underneath the main “Chess” folder and select “Run As JUnit Test.” A new window inside Eclipse will open and run our tests, indicating which ones passed or failed.
Installing TestNG
TestNG is a plugin for Eclipse that is required to run our program.  The download for TestNG can be found here:
